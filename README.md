# Hotel-customer-Feedback-Analysis

For my project, I utilized Microsoft Forms to solicit customer feedback from individuals who visited a hotel. The gathered data was meticulously organized and analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Drawing insights from the Excel analysis, I then crafted a detailed dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard not only effectively represented and interpreted customer feedback but was also designed with an OYO hotel theme, adding a distinctive visual element that resonates with the hospitality context. This integrated approach not only facilitated a comprehensive examination of customer sentiments but also enabled data-driven decision-making for enhancing the overall customer experience within the thematic ambiance of OYO hotels.
